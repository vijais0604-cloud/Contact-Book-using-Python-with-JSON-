# Contact-Book-using-Python-with-JSON-
This is a simple Python mini project that allows users to add, search, and delete contacts using a command-line interface. Contact data is stored persistently using a JSON file, so contacts are not lost when the program is closed.  The project demonstrates core Python concepts such as file handling, exception handling, object-oriented programming.
